## OffsetHelper

Helper functions that simplify the carbon offsetting (retirement)
process.

Retiring carbon tokens requires multiple steps and interactions with
Toucan Protocol's main contracts:
1. Obtain a Toucan pool token such as BCT or NCT (by performing a token
   swap).
2. Redeem the pool token for a TCO2 token.
3. Retire the TCO2 token.

These steps are combined in each of the following "auto offset" methods
implemented in `OffsetHelper` to allow a retirement within one transaction:
- `autoOffsetPoolToken()` if the user already owns a Toucan pool
  token such as BCT or NCT,
- `autoOffsetExactOutETH()` if the user would like to perform a retirement
  using the native token e.g. CELO, specifying the exact amount of TCO2s to retire,
- `autoOffsetExactInETH()` if the user would like to perform a retirement
  using the native token e.g. CELO, swapping all sent CELO into TCO2s,
- `autoOffsetExactOutToken()` if the user would like to perform a retirement
  using an ERC20 token (USDC, WETH or WMATIC), specifying the exact amount
  of TCO2s to retire,
- `autoOffsetExactInToken()` if the user would like to perform a retirement
  using an ERC20 token (USDC, WETH or WMATIC), specifying the exact amount
  of token to swap into TCO2s.

In these methods, "auto" refers to the fact that these methods use
`autoRedeem()` in order to automatically choose a TCO2 token corresponding
to the oldest tokenized carbon project in the specfified token pool.
There are no fees incurred by the user when using `autoRedeem()`, i.e., the
user receives 1 TCO2 token for each pool token (BCT/NCT) redeemed.

There are two `view` helper functions `calculateNeededETHAmount()` and
`calculateNeededTokenAmount()` that should be called before using
`autoOffsetExactOutETH()` and `autoOffsetExactOutToken()`, to determine how
much native token e.g. CELO, respectively how much of the ERC20 token must be sent to the
`OffsetHelper` contract in order to retire the specified amount of carbon.

The two `view` helper functions `calculateExpectedPoolTokenForETH()` and
`calculateExpectedPoolTokenForToken()` can be used to calculate the
expected amount of TCO2s that will be offset using functions
`autoOffsetExactInETH()` and `autoOffsetExactInToken()`.

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(string[] _eligibleTokenSymbols, address[] _eligibleTokenAddresses, string _baseToken, string _baseERC20) public
```

Contract constructor. Should specify arrays of ERC20 symbols and
addresses that can used by the contract.

_See `isEligible()` for a list of tokens that can be used in the
contract. These can be modified after deployment by the contract owner
using `setEligibleTokenAddress()` and `deleteEligibleTokenAddress()`._

| _baseToken | string | Symbol of the token the DEX uses to change to pool tokens e.g., NCTs |
| _baseERC20 | string | Symbol of ERC20 token to get the current amount to swap to the provided token symbols. |

### Redeemed

```solidity
event Redeemed(address who, address poolToken, address[] tco2s, uint256[] amounts)
